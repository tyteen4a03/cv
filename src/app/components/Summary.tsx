        <p>I am a software engineer with an interest in using tech for social good.</p>
        <p>
            Since my first website at 10 on GeoCities, I&apos;ve gone on to work on Minecraft custom servers, MMORPGs,
            web application used by millions, and led volunteer teams to deliver IT services powering a homeless shelter
            network every Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy being &quot;the glue&quot; to IT projects, working across disciplines to ensure it gets delivered on
            time, meets budget and satisfies users. I prefer full-stack development on the web but can also
            specialise into backend / frontend and other disciplines as needed.
